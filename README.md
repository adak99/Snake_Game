# Snake Game 🐍

This is a classic **Snake Game** developed in Java using the **Swing** library. Inspired by the traditional snake game,
the objective is simple: control the snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid collisions with your own body or the
wall.

## 🎮 Features

- **Responsive Controls:** Control the snake’s movement using the arrow keys.
- **Random Food Placement:** Food items appear at random positions on the board.
- **Score Tracking:** Each food item consumed increases your score.
- **Game Over Conditions:** The game ends if the snake collides with its own body or the wall.
- **Simple GUI:** Utilizes Java’s Swing framework for rendering graphics.
- **Customizable Board:** Easily adjust the board dimensions through code modifications.

## 📜 Code Overview

### `Main` Class

- **Purpose:** Initializes the game window using Java's `JFrame`.
- **Core Functionality:**
  - Sets up the game window size, visibility, and close operation.
  - Adds the `SnakeGame` panel to the frame and starts the game loop.

### `SnakeGame` Class

- **Purpose:** Handles the core game logic and rendering.
- **Attributes:**

  - **Tile Class:** Represents each segment of the snake and the food.
  - **Variables:** Manages game components like the snake’s segments, food, movement direction, score, and game-over
    status.

- **Core Methods:**
  - `draw(Graphics g)`: Renders the snake, food, and game-over screen.
  - `placeFood()`: Randomly places food on the board.
  - `move()`: Handles the snake's movement and checks for food consumption or collisions.
  - `collision(Tile tile1, Tile tile2)`: Checks for collisions between two tiles.
  - `actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)`: Moves the snake and updates the game state at each timer tick.
  - `keyPressed(KeyEvent e)`: Captures keyboard inputs to control the snake's direction.
